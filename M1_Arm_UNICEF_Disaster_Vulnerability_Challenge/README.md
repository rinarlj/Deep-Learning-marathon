# Arm UNICEF Disaster Vulnerability Challenge  

This project aims to classify **thatch-roofed, tin-roofed, and other houses** in aerial images of rural Malawi for disaster planning.  

## Objective  
Develop a machine-learning model to improve population estimates and disaster response in rural areas.  

## Context  
- Rural Malawi faces **floods, droughts, and landslides**.  
- Many houses have **thatch roofs**, which are often missed in satellite-based mapping.  
- Accurate classification helps improve **evacuations and aid distribution**.
